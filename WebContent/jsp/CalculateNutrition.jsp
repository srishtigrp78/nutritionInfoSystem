<p class="long">We all know that as we grow up, various hormonal changes take place in our body, due to which</p>
<p class="long">our need of nutrition changes.As an infant, a child needs as many nutrients as possible.</p>
<p class="long">Breastmilk is the best option for kids because it provides extra immune building properties,</p>
<p class="long"> as well as the necessary calories and fat a child needs.The human body is incredibly </p>
<p class="long">adaptable, and based on the amount a child breastfeeds; the body will continue to produce</p>
<p class="long"> the same amount. Yet, breastfeeding is not for everyone, and formula was designed to match</p>
<p class="long"> the nutrients found in breastmilk. The amount of vitamins and minerals found in breastmilk</p>
<p class="long">and formula are enough to meet nutritional needs of babies.</p>

<p class="long">As a child grows into toddlerhood, an emphasis needs to be made on whole foods. At this stage,</p>
<p class="long">a child is extremely active and is growing, therefore increasing their calorie and protein needs.</p>
<p class="long">This will not change as a child ages into adolescence. If a child is extremely active, he/she will</p>
<p class="long">need more nutrients(i.e. calories, fat, protein, etc). One important nutrient throughout childhood</p>
<p class="long">is calcium. Families can incorporate calcium through dairy rich foods, such as milk or cheese, and</p>
<p class="long">non-dairy foods, such as beans. In addition, a child needs to choose good sources of calories and</p>
<p class="long">fat to maintain proper growth and to increase energy without excess weight gain. For example, </p>
<p class="long">choosing more foods from fruit and vegetables will help a child meet his/her vitamin and mineral</p>
<p class="long">needs, while also incorporating calorie needs. </p>

<p class="long">Calorie needs vary depending on age, gender, and activity. Typically, adults need between 25-30 calories/kg </p>
<p class="long">per day. Infants need between 100-500 calories/kg per day, depending on the initial weight of the baby.</p>
<p class="long"> Once a child surpasses toddlerhood (age 4+), calorie needs decrease until adulthood. The table below shows</p>
<p class="long">the estimated breakdown for carbohydrate, protein, and fat needs (according to the Institute of Medicine): </p>

<table class="ontop" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="5">
<tr><th>Age(in years)</th><th>Carbohydrates</th><th>Protein</th><th>Fat</th></tr>
<tr><td>1-3</td><td>45-65%</td><td>5-20%</td><td>30-40%</td></tr>
<tr><td>4-18</td><td>45-65%</td><td>10-30%</td><td>25-35%</td></tr>
<tr><td>19+(adults)</td><td>45-65%</td><td>10-35%</td><td>20-35%</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="long">As a healthy adult, needs do not change drastically, and would only vary during pregnancy, lactation, and an</p>
<p class="long"> increase in physical activity. Based on recommendations from the Institute of Medicine, during pregnancy,</p>
<p class="long"> women need to increase their intake by 300 calories per day, and include 800-1000 mg of calcium and</p>
<p class="long"> 520 micrograms of folate. These amounts can vary depending on the age of the pregnant woman. If a woman</p>
<p class="long"> breastfeeds, calorie needs increase by 500 calories per day and Vitamin A increases to 900 micrograms per day</p>
 <p class="long">(compared to 500 micrograms per day).</p>
 
<p class="long">Overall, a healthy diet that incorporates whole grains, fruit, vegetables, lean protein and dairy products</p>
<p class="long"> should meet all of your needs.Increasing physical activity may require you to increase calories and protein. </p>
